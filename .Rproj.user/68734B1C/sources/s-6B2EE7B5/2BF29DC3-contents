# As with the IMI chemical cue detection experiment, this data was also created using
# a sepearate Excel sheet in the same Excel workbook for each turtle. So, we will need
# to save the data using the VBA interface of Excel.

# Instructions for saving data .xlsx file into multiple .csv files:

# 1. Press Alt + F11 keys simultaneously to open the Microsoft Visual Basic Application window.
# 
# 2. In the Microsoft Visual Basic Application window, click Insert > Module. Then copy and paste the following code into the Module window.
# 
# VBA code: Export all sheets to separated csv files:
#   
#   Sub ExportSheetsToCSV()
# Dim xWs As Worksheet
# Dim xcsvFile As String
# For Each xWs In Application.ActiveWorkbook.Worksheets
# xWs.Copy
# xcsvFile = CurDir & "\" & xWs.Name & ".csv"
#         Application.ActiveWorkbook.SaveAs Filename: = xcsvFile, _
#         FileFormat: = xlCSV, CreateBackup: = False
#         Application.ActiveWorkbook.Saved = True
#         Application.ActiveWorkbook.Close
#     Next
# End Sub


# Now that all of the Excel sheets are saved into individual .csv files, they are slightly
# (only slightly) easier to work with in R!
